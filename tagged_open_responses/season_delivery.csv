"For future seasons, players may hold off buying it until they see a game they like.
If week 8 comes out and they find there is a game they just MUST play.
They might be annoyed that they will have to wait a long time.

So buying said games outside of the season or having the option to ""Catch up"" might be worth while.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"My brother got his Playdate before me so we were a week apart. We had an experience where he showed me a game from the Season, Inventory Hero, that he liked quite a bit. I didn't know anything about it so it was a cool interaction where he showed me something new that he liked. That moment was cool. Although, I didn't have anything ""new"" to show him since he gets new Season games a week ahead of me. So its been one way for the Season games, he shows me Season games. I find new indie games on Itch.io but they aren't the same. I like the idea of Season games, it does create interesting social interactions. It does leave me with an impression, that the way this is done, is a bit strange. Why not ""Buy into"" the latest released games like how Season Passes work for Fighting games like Smash, Tekken 7. I guess the difference is it immediately introduces a back catalog for new users of games they'll get around to eventually (maybe stress for some?). Which waiting for the week to play the next game you know you want to play (ex. Crankin' Time Adventure) similar adds tension. Not to mention social pressure about games friends are playing but you haven't gotten yet. FOMO is strong. I think adding the option to sync users seasons to whoever has the latest week would be nice. Which would probably add a friend list or some kind of relationship ties between users.

I love the Season Delivery. I think it might be kinda cool to make the 2 games random out of the pool of games. Kind of like a Gachapon where you turn the crank on a virtual Playdate shaped Gachapon Machine. And you get 2 “plays” a week. Representing the 2 games you get for the week.
