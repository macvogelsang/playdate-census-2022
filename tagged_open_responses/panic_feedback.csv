"_I'm buying the Playdate first and foremost for the hardware_.... I actually don't care so much about the games, what I want / wanted a playdate for was the quality design and engineering. Reading the only sources of information / community I'm aware of, Discord and Reddit, it feels like there are a lot of quality control / fit / finish issues with the hardware and software (crank issues, difference in button feel / feedback, etc). Because of all of these reports, I've unfortunately lost some of my faith in the hardware, and the reason for wanting to own the product in the first place (Teenage Engineering + Panic) is diminished. To be clear, I think it's an amazing feat to have released the PlayDate, truly awesome work, and I certainly don't feel negative about anything. It's just that taken at face value, the Playdate has lost a bit of it's shine to me as a premium, robust, well engineered piece of hardware. ",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"For now, I've felt the Playdate as a developer platform because there isn't killer software.
If a user didn't know how to program and didn't express any interest in doing so, not wanting to use Pulp either, their bones would be brittle and their stomachs empty because there is little to nothing to consume. Developing for playdate is a huge plus and the main reason to have a playdate as of early July 2022. I wish this to change and Playdate to have a hit game people can really enjoy.

The passion of the developer community and people surrounding the Playdate is awesome. Coming home and coding something for myself has given me retrospective on why I wanted to code in the first place. A love for video games and how this medium can be used to express one's self. Playdate's Lua SDK makes it easy enough to start and design a small game. Limiting moreso in an opinionated basis of what a mobile game console fundamental control layout should be.

With the Playdate/Panic Podcasts I have a small glimpse into the real world difficulties of making a handheld. I appreciate the efforts that have been made to make this possible. I hope the employees at Panic treat themselves well, games aren't worth self ruin!

"You guys have made an incredible platform. I have not felt that freedom of development since the late eighties on Atari ST. I really want the console to be a huge success. Now, whatever you do, PLEASE do not put in place some kind of review system or red tape around development and publishing of third party games. This is your number one superpower. There's not a single console out there right now that is fully open but also so accessible to beginners. However, I think you need to attract star developers like Lucas Pope to have at least a few killer apps, to put the console on the map. And finally, I'm sure that there's been many reasons for which you chose not to have  back lighting, but let's face it: it is a deal breaker for many people, and I think it's the number one flaw that prevents the console from taking off. You just read forums and Youtube comments and Reddit and it's everywhere: people want backlight, or they won't buy it. If it was me, it would be my top priority to start R&D on a v2 with backlighting. ",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"I love Panic. I wanna see some major success. The console just isn't the right fit for me and I'm a little saddened by it. I was so eager with all the big names but as more info came out I got less and less enthusiastic. Ultimately I find myself looking like the ""but why"" meme. 

Monochrome display, low processing power, and a battery that only 'fits the need'. I want color I want something beefy and long lasting. I pretty much just want a gameboy 2. Powerful brick.

I feel like the niche you're aiming for is filled or could be done better by collaboration with a different entity than teenage engineering. (even just slapping some yellow paint on a Miyoo Mini would be cool XD)

The gimmick is fun but you guys really need to get better about how you communicate with your customers and community.The slow drip of games for people who are already months behind your preferred customers are forced to wait even longer to get access to what you have already taken their money for.
