"I think the most important thing to see over the next year or so is general support for more games, apps and system software from Panic, as well as independents. A relatively consistent stream of content and communication would keep my interest in using my console high, and I‚Äôd assume that would be the same for other users as well. Keeping the momentum of the device moving is what really interests me, as it would keep it afloat better, holding a stronger community and maintaining a longer lifespan.

Some hopes and dreams from me that aren‚Äôt really necessary, but would be cool could include the following:
New Lock Screens - either user made or developed in-house. I love the ones on the handheld, but it would be cool to rock even more just for fun
Easier Game Navigation - as my list of 3rd party content continues to expand well into the double digits, I‚Äôd live for more ways to navigate the home page, or maybe some level of general redesign for it. What that would look like? I‚Äôm not sure, but it would be nice, no doubt.
Expanded Menus
As I‚Äôm not a very prolific developer, I‚Äôm not actually totally sure on the current limits / abilities of the menu button on the play date at the moment, and am just basing it off of my current experiences in games. 
I think one of the things the playdate could have benefited from was an additional standard start and/or select button. The Menu button has cool uses, like the fun volume slider, and it‚Äôs multifunction as a menu in games is neat, but it often results in frustrating levels of complexity to complete tasks that could have otherwise been done with one star/select press. In some games, for example, the start button may normally bring up the map, but with the minimalist design of the playdate, the Menu button multitasks, and may bring up a smaller map next to the system menu, since there‚Äôs no other button to assign that to. However, due to the constrained nature of the Menu area, you would either have to scroll through several options to zoom into the smaller screen with a separate map, or settle for a tiny minimap that takes up only 2/3 of an already very small screen. 
It‚Äôs a tough situation for me. I‚Äôd love an eventual Playdate 2.0 with some extra features, like one or two extra buttons, but in the mean time, I‚Äôd love to see some expansion of the side Menu. Idk how possible it is, but allowing some extra level of modification from developers would be very cool, whether that be through different fonts, some sprites or even expansion farther to the left with some tweaking, I think there could be potential, as long as it is feasible from a development perspective.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

"Another season of games. A delivery mechanism for other games. Perhaps incentives or hackathons for user created content - something engaging beyond just a store.

If panic develop games or contract other developers I'd like to see even more old school style games - I'm thinking Amiga / Atari ST era games - especially of the genres that don't really exist anymore such as adventure. Or simulation / story experiences - something like Conflict: Middle Eastern political simulator.

Beyond 12 months - potentially more leaning into the 'play date' concept - how about some way to share gaming experiences at specific moments, with friends (events? Discoverable/unlockable schedulable events?) Anything from transient leaderboards to something like the 'watch party' Amazon Prime Video feature - imagine an experience where you play a segment then your friend somewhere else in the world plays a segment.
