"It's a little rough getting started with the ARM chain, I struggled at least... Any additional guides you could add here could help a lot of people!

I also was not expecting the simulator to want a different binary to the device, ""I'll compile using windows subsystem for Linux and then load it into the Windows simulator""... Nope!

"The build scripts that come with the SDK are all over the place.
