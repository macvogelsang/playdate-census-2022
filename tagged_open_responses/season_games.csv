Casual Birder is fun!

Crankin's is great, but even after the patch, I find some of the rapid cranking required a bit questionable as a first-party game…I am pretty sure I sustained hardware damage to the crank handle from that one.

Boogie Loops is a miss, the near-complete lack of text help is very confusing: I was expecting it to be some kind of rhythm game and spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the ""goal"" was before I realized it was more of a Mario Paint Composer type toy. Even once I understood that, I found it very underwhelming: the complete lack of any social or sharing/export features is a missed opportunity, and the fact that holding down the B button gives you a tooltip that is *blocked by the rest of the UI*, and this bug *still* hasn't been patched, is mind-boggling.

Lost Your Marbles is fun! I hope the developer publishes a guide to all the different paths and endings!

Pick Pack Pup is GREAT. Should've been in Week 1! A highlight!

Flipper Lifter: not my jam, but well-executed for what it is!

Echoic Memory: it whips. Great game, but as a more esoteric/less-accessible one, it coming a bit later feels right.

Demon Quest: Love it! Just like Lost Your Marbles: give us a guide! So many permutations!

Omaze: YES. YES. YES.

Hyper Metero: Yes!

Zipper: Another 'not my type, but still well-done' situation 👍🏻

Executive Golf DX: Small miss…idk, the gameplay doesn't do it for me. I do enjoy the art direction!

Questy Chess: Can't wrap my head around it. The crashiness, and slowness of interaction, and general lack of personality makes it hard to get excited about figuring it out…

"Lost Your Marbles, my brother didn't understand the gameplay dictates where the dialogue goes in the story and dropped it after thinking the gameplay was too easy and the story was non-sense. I explained there were multiple paths to take in a stage and it was possible to access ""good"", ""neutral"", and ""bad"" paths. However we both didn't last long. I enjoy the gameplay loop but even with the paths I thought dialogue was cringe. I don't like reading in games when its separated from the gameplay into other sections. Bring forth the fun moment to moment monkeyball-esque gameplay. Getting the good ending would be worth it.

"Honestly I find the season one games quite poor overall. Some of them feel downright amateur, with mediocre controls and beginner's game design flaws. And for the most part they don't retain my interest. I'm sorry for saying this but they feel like throwaway mobile gimmick games. That's not what I was expecting from the Playdate. I'd rather have less games but of higher quality. In fact I am a bit worried that if the Playdate doesn't rapidly get a few really good games, it might taint its reputation and threaten its future. I'm committed to make the best game I can, but I don't pretend making the killer app you need. All I know is that you need one. Even the third party games so far are very gimmicky and too expensive. I'm afraid that some developers out there see the lack of games as an opportunity for a quick buck by releasing anything they can as fast as possible to be the first on the market. I may be wrong. It's just my impression. I think the Playdate has enormous potential and it makes me a bit sad that very few people so far seem to take development seriously. I'm not saying it's everyone, but the majority. However please don't take this as an invitation to put in place a review system and lock up access to development on the console. That would kill the console for me. I have very high expectations for Lucas Pope game though, as I know that he is a very talented and serious developer. ",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"I've really enjoyed Season One so far. I'm currently on Week 5, and its been a nice blend of different titles. Pick Pack Pup, Demon Quest 85, and Lost Your Marbles are my current favorites.

My only issue is that the first 3 titles didn't really make a strong impression. Whitewater Wipeout was a cute gimmick title, but lacked any depth whatsoever aside from getting highscores. Casual Birder was also neat, but was really short. Those two, being launch titles really soured the first week for me. That followed by Boogie Loops made me a little bit afraid that all games would be...lacking in any form of direction or depth aside from the crank gimmick. Thankfully Crankin's Time Travelling Adventure was with Boogie Loops to cushion the blow.

My suggestion would be to maybe rethink what titles really fit the criteria of a ""weekly release"". Boogie Loops, while fun and has a use for music producers, just is not entertaining for your general consumer. They'll pick it up, realize they don't understand the clunky UI or just don't want to produce music, and drop it forever. It really should have been a pack-in title. Or, maybe with the new marketplace application that is being produced, have a part where bonus applications that don't necessarily fit the criteria of a full week release (like Boogie Loops) can be downloaded. 

Though honestly, keep at it with the current weekly release structure. One narrative and one puzzle/arcade game has been a good blend!",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
