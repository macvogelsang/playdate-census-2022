"I haven't used it in a bit, so apologies if this is out of date, but the error messaging for scripts is super intrusive. If there's an error in a script you basically can't do anything else until you fix it, including look around at other elements.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"i think pulp is greatly suited for small projects, but quite often it seems, those projects grow too big for pulp and might never end up releasing because the developers grow frustrated of the limitations. i'm sure those at panic who work on pulp are probably aware of this, but thought it'd be worth mentioning regardless. i'm really excited to see pulp grow and become an even more powerful tool for beginners",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
