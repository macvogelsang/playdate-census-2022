"The support was great, once it responded, but only getting a generic form automatic response until a human can respond much, much later, makes it feel like your submission has been lost in a black hole.

I understand you're a small company and are likely swamped with Playdate support, but that's all the more reason you really should be using one of those systems that assigns a ticket number in the auto-response (to give customers assurance there's a tracking system in place), allows replies to the first automatic email to be appended to the ticket, with copy in the email that indicates doing so will work, and finally, the first automatic email should include a copy of the original form response, so the person who needs support has a detailed record of exactly what they said, so that if the ticket needs to be updated, they can remember what's already been communicated.

Tl;dr, make it work like online support ticket systems usually work for consumers!",1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
