I found that I played and discovered and enjoyed a lot of games that I would never have thought to bother with in the past, all because the content was added in every Monday. It was a joy for that, and it was really interesting seeing some of the more unique games that came out of this first season. But that doesn’t mean everything was perfect.

A relatively consistent stream of content and communication would keep my interest in using my console high, and I’d assume that would be the same for other users as well. Keeping the momentum of the device moving is what really interests me, as it would keep it afloat better, holding a stronger community and maintaining a longer lifespan.

Some hopes and dreams from me that aren’t really necessary, but would be cool could include the following:
New Lock Screens - either user made or developed in-house. I love the ones on the handheld, but it would be cool to rock even more just for fun
Easier Game Navigation - as my list of 3rd party content continues to expand well into the double digits, I’d live for more ways to navigate the home page, or maybe some level of general redesign for it. What that would look like? I’m not sure, but it would be nice, no doubt.
Expanded Menus
As I’m not a very prolific developer, I’m not actually totally sure on the current limits / abilities of the menu button on the play date at the moment, and am just basing it off of my current experiences in games. 
I think one of the things the playdate could have benefited from was an additional standard start and/or select button. The Menu button has cool uses, like the fun volume slider, and it’s multifunction as a menu in games is neat, but it often results in frustrating levels of complexity to complete tasks that could have otherwise been done with one star/select press. In some games, for example, the start button may normally bring up the map, but with the minimalist design of the playdate, the Menu button multitasks, and may bring up a smaller map next to the system menu, since there’s no other button to assign that to. However, due to the constrained nature of the Menu area, you would either have to scroll through several options to zoom into the smaller screen with a separate map, or settle for a tiny minimap that takes up only 2/3 of an already very small screen. 
It’s a tough situation for me. I’d love an eventual Playdate 2.0 with some extra features, like one or two extra buttons, but in the mean time, I’d love to see some expansion of the side Menu. Idk how possible it is, but allowing some extra level of modification from developers would be very cool, whether that be through different fonts, some sprites or even expansion farther to the left with some tweaking, I think there could be potential, as long as it is feasible from a development perspective.","From what I’ve seen, the Panic team has been genuine in every interaction they’ve had. In the gaming industry, it’s pretty rare to see honest, kind individuals who are so passionate about creativity, and even rarer to see those who are so open with providing development tools, methods to contact and network, and all around accessibility into the game creation space. It’s been phenomenal seeing everything Panic has provided for its community, and I hope to see it continue as they and the Playdate community grows."

Basically efforts to support, expand and draw attention to the playdate development community. Maybe also some kind of youtube tutorials that people can follow along to make basic games, for example the Unity 2D Roguelike tutorials https://youtu.be/Fdcnt2-Jf4w or lazy devs for pico8: https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyDevs 

Basically seeing as it's an open development platform and people are starting to get their devices, I'd like to see more support and investment in getting people to develop for the playdate. As long term I think a healthy development community will be one of the most important things. Maybe the next 12 months is a bit short term to focus on that too much as people are mainly still worried about getting their devices at  but definitely 12-24 months I'd like that to be more of a focus.","I think the playdate is a really interesting project and I'm excited to try and develop for it.

I understand you're a small company and are likely swamped with Playdate support, but that's all the more reason you really should be using one of those systems that assigns a ticket number in the auto-response (to give customers assurance there's a tracking system in place), allows replies to the first automatic email to be appended to the ticket, with copy in the email that indicates doing so will work, and finally, the first automatic email should include a copy of the original form response, so the person who needs support has a detailed record of exactly what they said, so that if the ticket needs to be updated, they can remember what's already been communicated.

Tl;dr, make it work like online support ticket systems usually work for consumers!",4,It's great! The only reason I didn't give it the full 5/5 is I find some of the week 1/2 choices a bit questionable as an early welcome for new owners…,Yes,4,,"Whitewater wipeout is rewarding, but a bit punishing and its old-school ""no handholding"" approach makes it not the most approachable, so to me that is an odd choice for a week one game.

Casual Birder is fun!

Crankin's is great, but even after the patch, I find some of the rapid cranking required a bit questionable as a first-party game…I am pretty sure I sustained hardware damage to the crank handle from that one.

Boogie Loops is a miss, the near-complete lack of text help is very confusing: I was expecting it to be some kind of rhythm game and spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the ""goal"" was before I realized it was more of a Mario Paint Composer type toy. Even once I understood that, I found it very underwhelming: the complete lack of any social or sharing/export features is a missed opportunity, and the fact that holding down the B button gives you a tooltip that is *blocked by the rest of the UI*, and this bug *still* hasn't been patched, is mind-boggling.

Lost Your Marbles is fun! I hope the developer publishes a guide to all the different paths and endings!

Pick Pack Pup is GREAT. Should've been in Week 1! A highlight!

Flipper Lifter: not my jam, but well-executed for what it is!

Echoic Memory: it whips. Great game, but as a more esoteric/less-accessible one, it coming a bit later feels right.

Demon Quest: Love it! Just like Lost Your Marbles: give us a guide! So many permutations!

Omaze: YES. YES. YES.

Hyper Metero: Yes!

Zipper: Another 'not my type, but still well-done' situation 👍🏻

Executive Golf DX: Small miss…idk, the gameplay doesn't do it for me. I do enjoy the art direction!

Questy Chess: Can't wrap my head around it. The crashiness, and slowness of interaction, and general lack of personality makes it hard to get excited about figuring it out…

A delivery mechanism for other games. Perhaps incentives or hackathons for user created content - something engaging beyond just a store.

If panic develop games or contract other developers I'd like to see even more old school style games - I'm thinking Amiga / Atari ST era games - especially of the genres that don't really exist anymore such as adventure. Or simulation / story experiences - something like Conflict: Middle Eastern political simulator.

Beyond 12 months - potentially more leaning into the 'play date' concept - how about some way to share gaming experiences at specific moments, with friends (events? Discoverable/unlockable schedulable events?) Anything from transient leaderboards to something like the 'watch party' Amazon Prime Video feature - imagine an experience where you play a segment then your friend somewhere else in the world plays a segment. I like the idea of a play date for adults - helping bring friends together for a short amount of time in a busy world where it's not always possible to make the time to log on for 5 hours of Overwatch.","Your tone of voice is excellent - your YouTube content really portrays you as a nice place to work, small environment of passionate people attempting something difficult, for the love of it. This is endearing and honestly I'm happy to support you just because of that. Your level of differentiation with the playdate seems good - i.e. high. It is an expensive novelty device for enthusiasts - I think the seasons idea is an excellent attempt to support some more frequent user retention. I hope it works.

Payoff might not be immediate but I think having third party sources keeping track of this info is worthwhile.

Keep improving it 👍,"The SDK and developer tools. For a seasoned programmer, they are easy enough to pick up and use. I find it odd Lua starts at 1 for indexing arrays and tables","I like the yellow, it wouldn't be my first choice if there were other options though.

Maybe even Pink?",Yes,Yes,Group #1,Maybe,Yes,Yes,4,No,,Yes,"From the OS update 11.1 onwards my unit is experiencing issues that were fixed in other units. Pixel lines through the screen when transitioning from System Menu to Game vice versa. The always on clock display turning to all white during a minute, intermediate throughout the day. 

Running software has no weird issues, these are OS issues
I will say, some software did break from OS update 12.0. Like Wani Wani Panic, character walking on the ceiling, and received an update from the author to address these issues

Slight paranoia on the crank cracking after extended use, I can feel some give if I squeeze on yellow plastic handle. Moreso a later maintenance problem then a current defect

I didn't have OS problems before 11.1 the unit worked as expected with no issues",5,"I haven't needed to contact Panic support, which means the current process is very good. I did think about adding the Playdate Cover to my preorder before my unit arrived. There was good feedback and visible success shown from users who contacted Panic Support for this on Twitter. I still didn't attempt to reach out because I didn't think it was worth the hassle if I couldn't do it myself.",5,"My brother got his Playdate before me so we were a week apart. We had an experience where he showed me a game from the Season, Inventory Hero, that he liked quite a bit. I didn't know anything about it so it was a cool interaction where he showed me something new that he liked. That moment was cool. Although, I didn't have anything ""new"" to show him since he gets new Season games a week ahead of me. So its been one way for the Season games, he shows me Season games. I find new indie games on Itch.io but they aren't the same. I like the idea of Season games, it does create interesting social interactions. It does leave me with an impression, that the way this is done, is a bit strange. Why not ""Buy into"" the latest released games like how Season Passes work for Fighting games like Smash, Tekken 7. I guess the difference is it immediately introduces a back catalog for new users of games they'll get around to eventually (maybe stress for some?). Which waiting for the week to play the next game you know you want to play (ex. Crankin' Time Adventure) similar adds tension. Not to mention social pressure about games friends are playing but you haven't gotten yet. FOMO is strong. I think adding the option to sync users seasons to whoever has the latest week would be nice. Which would probably add a friend list or some kind of relationship ties between users. For now it's the way it is, stick to your guns 🔫 now but maybe reflect on what could be done for other Seasons.",I'm not avoiding spoilers,3,,"Lost Your Marbles, my brother didn't understand the gameplay dictates where the dialogue goes in the story and dropped it after thinking the gameplay was too easy and the story was non-sense. I explained there were multiple paths to take in a stage and it was possible to access ""good"", ""neutral"", and ""bad"" paths. However we both didn't last long. I enjoy the gameplay loop but even with the paths I thought dialogue was cringe. I don't like reading in games when its separated from the gameplay into other sections. Bring forth the fun moment to moment monkeyball-esque gameplay. Getting the good ending would be worth it.

So far I haven't touched a game that makes me go yeah this is the reason I got a Playdate for. Crankin' Time Travel Adventure is so close (Level 9 boo!),"For now, I've felt the Playdate as a developer platform because there isn't killer software.
If a user didn't know how to program and didn't express any interest in doing so, not wanting to use Pulp either, their bones would be brittle and their stomachs empty because there is little to nothing to consume. Developing for playdate is a huge plus and the main reason to have a playdate as of early July 2022. I wish this to change and Playdate to have a hit game people can really enjoy.

The passion of the developer community and people surrounding the Playdate is awesome. Coming home and coding something for myself has given me retrospective on why I wanted to code in the first place. A love for video games and how this medium can be used to express one's self. Playdate's Lua SDK makes it easy enough to start and design a small game. Limiting moreso in an opinionated basis of what a mobile game console fundamental control layout should be.

With the Playdate/Panic Podcasts I have a small glimpse into the real world difficulties of making a handheld. I appreciate the efforts that have been made to make this possible. I hope the employees at Panic treat themselves well, games aren't worth self ruin!

I wish success for this company, product, and community so we can have more games on Playdate. I'm invested into seeing through what the future of Playdate becomes."

I didn't mind waiting to get it replaced, but I did feel a bit ignored.",1,"Frankly I don't like not being able to choose my games. It's okay for now because I considered that I mainly paid for the console for the first season, but I won't pay for a bunch of games imposed on me, especially if they're not of better quality than the first season. But even then, there are games that I am just not interested in, and I think the Playdate, more than any other console, is the platform where I want to have the opportunity to support only the developers whom I like. It feels a bit corporate and scummy to have a selection of games forced in me, when I don't know anything about the review process, or their quality. I don't mean this as a disparaging comment. I understand that you want to try a new model, but it's not for me. I think a genuine online shop where I can buy my games is a must.",Mostly,2,Echoic Memory,"Honestly I find the season one games quite poor overall. Some of them feel downright amateur, with mediocre controls and beginner's game design flaws. And for the most part they don't retain my interest. I'm sorry for saying this but they feel like throwaway mobile gimmick games. That's not what I was expecting from the Playdate. I'd rather have less games but of higher quality. In fact I am a bit worried that if the Playdate doesn't rapidly get a few really good games, it might taint its reputation and threaten its future. I'm committed to make the best game I can, but I don't pretend making the killer app you need. All I know is that you need one. Even the third party games so far are very gimmicky and too expensive. I'm afraid that some developers out there see the lack of games as an opportunity for a quick buck by releasing anything they can as fast as possible to be the first on the market. I may be wrong. It's just my impression. I think the Playdate has enormous potential and it makes me a bit sad that very few people so far seem to take development seriously. I'm not saying it's everyone, but the majority. However please don't take this as an invitation to put in place a review system and lock up access to development on the console. That would kill the console for me. I have very high expectations for Lucas Pope game though, as I know that he is a very talented and serious developer.

(Atlantic '41),Gamemaker,Yes,No,Lua,"I would love a beginner's guide to integrating C to Lua. Something that explains step by step with a very simple example how to build an hybrid game and test it in the simulator. I also think that the simulator needs to reflect the true performance of the system. I have the Playdate now but I was forced to develop in the dark for months. And considering how slowly you get the Playdates in people's hands (not a critic), I think it's crucial that people can test their code with relative confidence that it will run on platform. Also, I would love if the SDK could generate a little executable that both PC and Mac Users could run without having to download anything.",You guys are doing a great job. I am truly impressed!,No,"I think Pulp is too limited for my game, so I may not be the best judge. However, I think it's a very bizarre decision to limit the games to half resolution. I would get rid of that arbitrary limitation as soon as possible. I also think that being able to integrate Lua scripting in Pulp would be great.","The tools seem great, even if I haven't used them in production. I just played a bit with them. But I really think that you should allow full resolution to the Pulp games. ",,4,"A few VERY good games, that would establish the Playdate as a legit platform. Also, you're going to hate me for this, but I need a v.2.0 with backlighting. I'll be very honest: I wouldn't even considered buying the console if not for the fact that I want to develop a game for it, simply for the fact that it has no backlight. It is a deal breaker for me. I would also love different colors, and a better battery life, especially on sleep.","You guys have made an incredible platform. I have not felt that freedom of development since the late eighties on Atari ST. I really want the console to be a huge success. Now, whatever you do, PLEASE do not put in place some kind of review system or red tape around development and publishing of third party games. This is your number one superpower. There's not a single console out there right now that is fully open but also so accessible to beginners. However, I think you need to attract star developers like Lucas Pope to have at least a few killer apps, to put the console on the map. And finally, I'm sure that there's been many reasons for which you chose not to have  back lighting, but let's face it: it is a deal breaker for many people, and I think it's the number one flaw that prevents the console from taking off. You just read forums and Youtube comments and Reddit and it's everywhere: people want backlight, or they won't buy it. If it was me, it would be my top priority to start R&D on a v2 with backlighting. "

Monochrome display, low processing power, and a battery that only 'fits the need'. I want color I want something beefy and long lasting. I pretty much just want a gameboy 2. Powerful brick.

I feel like the niche you're aiming for is filled or could be done better by collaboration with a different entity than teenage engineering. (even just slapping some yellow paint on a Miyoo Mini would be cool XD)

My only issue is that the first 3 titles didn't really make a strong impression. Whitewater Wipeout was a cute gimmick title, but lacked any depth whatsoever aside from getting highscores. Casual Birder was also neat, but was really short. Those two, being launch titles really soured the first week for me. That followed by Boogie Loops made me a little bit afraid that all games would be...lacking in any form of direction or depth aside from the crank gimmick. Thankfully Crankin's Time Travelling Adventure was with Boogie Loops to cushion the blow.

My suggestion would be to maybe rethink what titles really fit the criteria of a ""weekly release"". Boogie Loops, while fun and has a use for music producers, just is not entertaining for your general consumer. They'll pick it up, realize they don't understand the clunky UI or just don't want to produce music, and drop it forever. It really should have been a pack-in title. Or, maybe with the new marketplace application that is being produced, have a part where bonus applications that don't necessarily fit the criteria of a full week release (like Boogie Loops) can be downloaded.
